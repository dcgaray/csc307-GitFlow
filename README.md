# csc307-GitFlow
Diego Christopher Garay -

This repository has been made for my intro to software engineering course csc307 at Cal Poly SLO. The goal of this lab is to help get myself comfortable with Git, and learning how to branch/merge, create pull requests, and solve merge conflicts.

It is far from my first time using Github, and I have basic knowledge of how to do everything my professor aims for me to learn, but hopefully this lab will be a nice refresher to reinforce the skills I already have.
